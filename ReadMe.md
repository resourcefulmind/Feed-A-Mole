### This is a repository for a game called Feed-a-mole

It is practice based and the last part of my FrontEndMasters Bootcamp.

The game itself shows the bird feeding the moles and if you feed one successfully, then the mole is happy and if you do not, then the mole is sad.

It was built using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
